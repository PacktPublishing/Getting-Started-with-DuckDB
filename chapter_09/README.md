# Using the DuckDB R API

This directory contains the accompanying material for from chapter 9 of *Getting Started with DuckDB*.

The code examples from this chapter are made available as both an R Markdown document and a Jupyter Notebook:
1. `chapter_09.Rmd`: R Markdown
2. `chapter_09.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook

See the *Technical requirements* section of the either of these for the dependencies required to run these examples.
